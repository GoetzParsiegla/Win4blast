What you have to do :

Install Python (for example 3.8.2) from python.org  (Works also with Python 2.7 if already installed).\
Install the wx.python utilities from https://pypi.org/project/wxPython/ \
This is done by using > pip install –U wxPython-version.whl\
Put the win4blast.pyw file in a working directory\
Change the default application for .pyw files to the python executive (an icon with a rocket in it) and for .txt files to wordpad (if not already default)

Or simply use the Windows installer

Install the latetst NCBI blast version from :
 	https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/

Known Bugs :
Blast still doesn’t allow white spaces in the path of its executables (makedb or blast)
